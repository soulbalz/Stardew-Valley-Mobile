Keep your head screwed on right and you’ll make it through in one piece… That’s what my Pappy always used to say. Heh heh heh.”\nPam is a villager who lives the trailer just west of the river in Pelican Town. She was the driver of the Pelican Town bus before it broke down.\nMost days Pam can be found in her trailer until 12:00 PM. She’ll then walk over to JojaMart for a few hours, leaving there at 4:00 PM to walk to the saloon. Pam is one of Gus‘s most loyal customers, she spends every evening in his establishment.",
